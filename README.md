# Responsive HTML Email Template

This repository contains a **responsive HTML email template** I created to demonstrate my email development skills. It’s designed to render consistently across major email clients, including Gmail, Outlook, and iOS Mail.

## Features

- Pixel-perfect table-based layout
- Responsive design that adapts smoothly to different screen sizes
- Tested on popular email clients to handle rendering quirks
- Inline CSS for maximum compatibility
- Clean, readable, and easy to customise code
